// SOLID principles:

// Single Responsibility: a class should only have one responsibility

// Open/Closed: Open for extension, closed for modification

// Liskov Substitution: if class A is a subtype of class B
// we should be able to replace B with A without disrupting the behavior of our program

// Interface Segregation: larger interfaces should be split into smaller ones
// By doing so, we can ensure that implementing classes only need to be concerned about the methods that are of interest to them

// Dependency Inversion: The principle of dependency inversion refers to the decoupling of software modules
// This way, instead of high-level modules depending on low-level modules, both will depend on abstractions
